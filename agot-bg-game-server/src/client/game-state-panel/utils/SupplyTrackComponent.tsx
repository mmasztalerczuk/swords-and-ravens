                            maximum size and count of each player's armies. (An army is made up
                            of two or more units within the same land or sea area.) The supply
                            track is updated from game effects, such as the "Supply" Westeros
                            card. The updated supply position is determined by the number of
                            Supply icons printed in areas that the player controls.
