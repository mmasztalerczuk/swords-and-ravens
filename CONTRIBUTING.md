# Contributing

**Swords and Ravens** is an open-source project and has received the help of many contributors.
In order to make the contribution process faster for all the process involved, a certain series of
steps must be done for a contribution to be integrated to the codebase and, ultimately, on the production
environment.

## Familiarizing yourself with the codebase

Technical documentation is located inside [README.md](./README.md). It is sparse, but it should contain
the information necessary to have a good overview of the codebase, and have a local environment up and running.

## Contributing Process

* Make sure to create an issue (both for bugs and features) before working on any implementation.
  This will allow me and regular contributors to possibly help you on detailing where changes will
  need to be made in the code in order to resolve the issue.
* In case of a new feature, make sure to detail exactly what you think should be added to Swords
  and Ravens. If it's related to the UI, don't hesitate to include a mock-up of how the features
  would look once implemented.
* I'm generally open to features for S&R, but I reserve myself the right to refuse a feature if
  I feel like it would not be a good fit for the project. 

**Note:** If you want to contribute but have no precise features to work on, you can search for issues
with the `up for grab` label. If an issue doesn't have this label and you feel like it should, don't
hesitate to write a comment on the issue asking on whether it can be implemented.

Once you know the issue you want to work on, you can begin implementation on it. Don't hesitate to
ask for help on how to implement a feature.

Once done, you can create a Pull Request on GitHub to have the feature merged in the codebase:

* Base your PR off `master` and try to keep it updated as much as possible, by using `git rebase master`.
* PR must be reviewed by myself before being merged into the codebase.
* If the PR includes changes to the UI, add a screenshot of the changes in the PR, this will help
  fasten the review process.

# Communication

Development discussions happens either inside issues, pull requests or in the `#dev-channel` of the [Discord of the project](https://discord.gg/6NhRrtV).
