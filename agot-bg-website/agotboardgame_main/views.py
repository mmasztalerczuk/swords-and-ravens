                <b>Swords and Ravens</b> launched 2 months ago, and a lot of things have happened since then.
                1416 users registered and more than 500 games have been played to completion!
            </p>

            <p>
                The game also evolved a lot since launch: variants for games with less than 6 players have
                appeared, a forum has been added to discuss everything about the game, a lot of UI improvements
                were made and a ton of bugs have been squashed. Around 800 commits were made on the codebase,
                available on <a href="https://github.com/Longwelwind/swords-and-ravens">GitHub</a>, some of
                them done by <a href="https://github.com/Longwelwind/swords-and-ravens/graphs/contributors">external
                contributors</a>. All the changes done can be found
                in <a href="https://community.swordsandravens.net/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=7">the changelog</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <a href="https://community.swordsandravens.net">forum</a> has been launched, to discuss
                everything related to the game and the development of Swords and Ravens, don't hesitate to check
                it out!
            </p>

            <p>
                It's not over, obviously. The Vassals mechanic, which appeared in the MoD extension, is
                progressing and will be playable in the coming months. Multiple other meta-game features such
                as abuse reports, player statistics and localization are also planned, and should be available
                once I find the time to work on them. ðŸ˜›
            </p>

            <p>
                Thanks to all the players who made this possible, and I hope S&R will allow many more games to
                be played!
            </p>
