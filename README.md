## General Architecture

The project is separated into 2 components:

* A website in `Python` with the `Django` framework. This component handles user registrations, creating games as well as a joining them. It exposes a REST API used by the game server. Finally, it also contains the logic for the chat used in the games. The code is located in `agot-bg-website/`.
* A game server in `Typescript` with `React`, `mobx` and `bootstrap`. It runs the games of AGoT. It is itself composed of a front-end and a back-end. The code is located in `agot-bg-game-server/`.

Additional documentation about how those components work can be found in the folder of each component.

## How to Run

There a multiple ways to run the code, depending on what components on what you want to run.

### Launching the Game Only

Requires `NodeJS` and `yarn`. Install the dependencies and initialize the environment variables by executing:

```bash
cd agot-bg-game-server/
yarn install
yarn run generate-json-schemas
cp .env.dev.local .env
```

In 2 different terminals, execute:

* `yarn run run-client`
* `yarn run run-server`

Open `http://localhost:8080/static/#1` in your browser. Additional players can be simulated by opening new browser tabs and changing the number at the end of the url.

Closing and re-reunning `run-server` will create a new game.

**Note**: The chat, which is managed by the website, will not be available.

### Launching the Website Only

Requires `docker` and `python3`.

To spin up the PostgreSQL database and a Redis database, open a terminal and execute `docker-compose up`.

Install the dependencies of the component, initialize the database and create a super user by running:

```bash
cd agot-bg-website/
cp .env.dev .env
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 manage.py migrate

# This command will ask for a password. Use "rootroot"
python3 manage.py createsuperuser --username Longwelwind
```

Once done, you can run the server by executing:

```bash
python3 manage.py runserver
```

The website will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000/` (as well as `http://localhost:8000/admin`). Some functionalities such as mail notifications and social authentications will require environment variables defined in `.env`.

**Note**: If you try to open a game via the website, you will land on a template page.

### Launching the Game and the Website

To launch the 2 components and make them inter-connected, make sure the dependencies are installed and the database is up and running (follow the instructions given in the precedent sections).

Replace the environment configuration of the game-server with a live one: `cp .env.live .env`.

The front-end of the game server must be built and placed in the website. This can be done by executing `./build_and_place_game_client_into_django.sh`.

You can now run the game server and the website by launching, in 2 two different terminals:

* In `agot-bg-game-server/`, execute `yarn run run-server`.
* In `agot-bg-website/`, execute `python3 manage.py runserver`.
